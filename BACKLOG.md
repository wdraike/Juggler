# Juggler — Backlog

_Last consolidated: 2026-05-14 (Phase 08 + cross-day split)_

This is the canonical open-work index for `juggler/`.

**Location decision (user choice 2026-05-11, Option A):** This file lives **inside the
`juggler/` submodule** as `juggler/BACKLOG.md`. Each update requires a submodule commit
and a monorepo pointer bump — the trade-off is accepted in exchange for keeping each
service's backlog inside its own repo (so juggler-specific consumers see it without the
monorepo).

**Scope of this file:**
- 3 items from the informal `Juggler Backlog Thoughts.md` vault note (now purged).
- 6 hand-written `.planning/todos/pending/` files (pre-audit). These remain the canonical
  individual files; this BACKLOG.md references them so they are not lost amid the 102
  machine-generated juggler audit todos.
- 2 items reflected from `MASTER-PLAN.md` JUGGLER section (Hold + Open).
- An aggregate-count summary of the 102 `juggler-{db,deadcode,perf,deadui,security}-*`
  machine-generated todos per RESEARCH §6.

## Source-file column convention

`Source File` points to the canonical record for each row. For hand-written todos
that's a path in `.planning/todos/pending/`. For consolidated vault notes (now
purged), the row is the canonical record itself; no source remains.

| ID | Title | Source File | Source Line | Last-Touched | Blocker |
|----|-------|-------------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| ~~JUG-HIGH-04~~ | ~~Multi-server readiness audit — validate all code for safe horizontal scaling~~ | — | — | 2026-05-14 | **FIXED** — Phase 07 shipped 4 fixes: FIX-01 TTL sweep replaces blanket startup `sync_locks DELETE` (f06750d); FIX-03 OAuth `usedCodes` Set → DB-backed `markCodeUsed` (048f74e); FIX-04 `scheduleQueue.pollLoop` → DB atomic claiming (0032017); FIX-05 AI rate limiter MemoryStore → RedisStore (15705d9). Post-review fixes CR-01/CR-03/WR-03/WR-05 applied. Remaining audit areas (job queues, filesystem, calendar sync locks) confirmed safe or out-of-scope for current single-instance deploy. |
| ~~JUG-HIGH-01~~ | ~~Apple last-modified field not extracted on sync ingest~~ | — | — | 2026-05-14 | **FIXED** — ETag-based change detection (commit 4d5c805). Migration `20260514000300` adds `provider_etag` to `cal_sync_ledger`; Apple CalDAV ETags replace the absent `LAST-MODIFIED`. |
| ~~JUG-HIGH-02~~ | ~~Cloud Tasks admin UI fixes~~ | — | — | 2026-05-14 | **MOVED** — belongs in resume-optimizer; tracked as `RO-HIGH-11` in `resume-optimizer/BACKLOG.md`. |
| ~~JUG-HIGH-03~~ | ~~Calendar views must show skipped & done tasks from the past~~ | — | — | 2026-05-14 | **FIXED** — `isPast` guard in DayView + DailyView `matchesFilter` (commit cdcdaef). Past-day done/skip/cancel always visible regardless of filter mode. |

## Medium

| ID | Title | Source File | Source Line | Last-Touched | Blocker |
|----|-------|-------------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| ~~JUG-MED-08~~ | ~~Scheduler nudge + health fix~~ | — | — | 2026-05-14 | **DONE** — Phase 08 shipped: `POST /api/schedule/nudge` (JWT, queued via `enqueueScheduleRun`); frontend `visibilityState`-aware timer resets on SSE; health check replaced with stuck-claim query + `getLastError()` 10-min window; `idle`/`stale` states removed (commits 7530e7e, 00393a0). |
| ~~JUG-MED-09~~ | ~~Cross-day splits for tpc recurring tasks~~ | — | — | 2026-05-14 | **DONE** — Split chunks of timesPerCycle recurring tasks now spread across the interval window (day before next occurrence) instead of being locked to the anchor day. `nextTpcOccDateByKey` map in `runSchedule.js` caps deadline per chunk; `splitTot > 1` removed from `isDayLocked` in `unifiedScheduleV2.js`. Daily tpc self-limits via `cycleDays=1` (commit 3052ef6). |
| ~~JUG-MED-11~~ | ~~Task card right-edge overflow — weather badge + count indicator clip at viewport boundary~~ | — | — | 2026-05-19 | **DONE** — `flexWrap: 'wrap'` + `minWidth: 0` on TaskCard Row 2 container + spacer (`flex: '1 1 0%'`); same fix on ListView date-group header. Badges wrap instead of clipping. 3 regression tests added (`TaskCard.overflow.test.jsx`); 99/99 pass. Human-verified at 375/768/1280px light+dark (commit `1665506`). |
| JUG-MED-12 | `/health` router: add mount-level auth guard (defense-in-depth) | — | — | 2026-05-20 | `app.js` mounts health router at `/health` and `/api/health` without outer `authenticateJWT`. Auth IS applied correctly inside each route handler (no live vulnerability). Risk: any new sub-route added to `health.routes.js` will be unauthenticated by default. Fix: add `router.use(authenticateJWT)` at the top of `health.routes.js`, or comment the mount sites documenting the per-route auth pattern. Found by peneloppy during weather cache fix review (2026-05-20). |
| JUG-MED-10 | All-day tasks: consistent full-day reminder display across all views | (user-reported 2026-05-18) | — | 2026-05-18 | All-day tasks (`when='allday'`) are skipped by the scheduler (`if (allday) return` in `buildItems`). They represent whole-day reminders (holidays, birthdays, non-time-bound commitments) and must NOT appear in the timed schedule grid. Required: (1) every calendar view (DayView, DailyView, WeekView, any future views) must render all-day tasks as a full-width banner/chip in a dedicated all-day row above the time grid; (2) they should never appear as timed blocks floating somewhere in the grid; (3) the banner style should visually distinguish them from scheduled tasks (softer/muted, no time label). JUG-MED-01 partially addressed sorting in CalendarView + DailyView banner; verify DayView and any other views are fully consistent and that no all-day item bleeds into the timed grid. |
| JUG-MED-07 <a id="scheduler-visual-docs"></a> | Scheduler — full visual documentation (Mermaid diagrams or equivalent) | (user-reported 2026-05-12) | — | 2026-05-14 | Document the scheduler end-to-end using visual tools (Mermaid, HTML flowcharts, or similar). Cover: trigger sources, scheduling algorithm flow, state transitions, split/chain/recurring paths, event queue integration. Goal: anyone can understand the scheduler from the diagrams alone. |
| ~~JUG-MED-01~~ | ~~Show all-day events at top of calendar view~~ | — | — | 2026-05-14 | **FIXED** — CalendarView sort + DailyView all-day banner (commit 2f94a01). DayView already correct. |
| ~~JUG-MED-02~~ | ~~Sort out icons for weather (currently confusing)~~ | — | — | 2026-05-14 | **FIXED** — Meteocons SVG icons, per-code WMO mapping, Comp C badge layout (icon 20px + hi/lo + raindrop 14px + precip%). Shared util `weatherIcons.js`; 4 duplicate `weatherCodeIcon()` fns removed. Sketch 001 documents decisions. |
| ~~JUG-MED-03~~ | ~~Fix sync frequency issues~~ | — | — | 2026-05-14 | **FIXED** — 3 RCs fixed: (1) Apple excluded from polling interval — added `appleFreq`/`appleAuto` to `AppLayout.jsx` loop and `activeFreqs` push; (2) `has-changes` local-change check used only `gcal_last_synced_at` — now uses max of all 3 provider timestamps so MSFT/Apple-only users get local-change detection (`cal-sync.controller.js`); (3) `calSyncSettings` object reference in `useEffect` dep array caused interval to restart every render — extracted primitive `gcalFreq`/`msftFreq`/`appleFreq` numbers before the effect, deps are now stable. |
| ~~JUG-MED-04~~ | ~~ClimbRS header consistency~~ | — | — | 2026-05-14 | **ALREADY DONE** — MASTER-PLAN.md confirms ✅ done in resume-optimizer/ClimbRS. |
| ~~JUG-MED-05~~ | ~~Header responsive layout — auto-scale, eliminate overlaps~~ | — | — | 2026-05-14 | **ALREADY DONE** — commit `c2c284a` (ResizeObserver collapse). Confirmed in git log. |
| ~~JUG-MED-06~~ | ~~Sync ingest — treat event as reminder vs. time-consuming task~~ | — | — | 2026-05-14 | **ALREADY DONE** — migration `20260505000100_add_ingest_mode_to_user_calendars` confirmed in DB. |

| JUG-HOLD-01 | `timesPerCycle` work-budget-aware | MASTER-PLAN.md (JUGGLER → Hold) | "tpc currently occurrence-count-based, not work-budget-based" | 2026-05-14 | Design question: suppress slots when `sum(time_remaining) < session_dur`, or keep occurrence-count + manual tpc adjust? Files: `shared/scheduler/expandRecurring.js` (tpc slot accounting), `src/scheduler/runSchedule.js` (`time_remaining → effectiveDur`). Held for UX review. Note: cross-day tpc splits shipped (commit 3052ef6) — time_remaining remains per-instance; this item is about suppressing extra occurrences when overall work is nearly done. |
