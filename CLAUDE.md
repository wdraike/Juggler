# Juggler — Claude Instructions

## Stack
React (port 3003) | Node.js/Express (port 5002) | MySQL + Knex.js | MCP server (`juggler-mcp/`)

## Key Commands
```bash
npm run lint && npm test              # Quality gate
# Start services individually from juggler-backend/ and juggler-frontend/
```

## Scheduler — Critical Architecture

**Core principle:** Schedule tasks most-constrained → least-constrained. Never reverse this.

**Task type terminology** (use these exact terms):
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `one-off` | Single standalone task |
| `chain member` | Task linked in a dependency chain |
| `recurring instance` | One occurrence of a repeating task |
| `split chunk` | A piece of a task split across time blocks |

**Severity hierarchy:** Deadlines > dependencies > preferences. A task with a hard deadline beats one with only a soft preference constraint.

**Recurring tasks:** Instances must be scheduled on the **same day** as their recurrence rule fires. Never place a recurring instance on a different day.

**Event queue pattern:**
- Scheduler is triggered by user/MCP mutations only — never self-triggers
- Only write tasks that actually changed (delta writes, not full rebuilds)
- No cascading scheduler calls from within the scheduler

**⚠️ Caution:** Scheduler bugs cascade and corrupt all task data. Test exhaustively before deploying any scheduler change. The `unifiedScheduleV2.js` is the main entry point.

## Scheduler Key Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/scheduler/unifiedScheduleV2.js` | Main scheduler entry point |
| `src/scheduler/runSchedule.js` | Schedule execution runner |
| `src/scheduler/scheduleQueue.js` | Event queue |
| `src/scheduler/reconcileOccurrences.js` | Recurring instance reconciliation |
| `src/scheduler/dependencyHelpers.js` | Chain/dependency resolution |
| `juggler-backend/docs/SCHEDULER.md` | Full design doc |
| `juggler-backend/docs/TASK-PROPERTIES.md` | All task fields |
| `juggler-backend/docs/TASK-STATE-MATRIX.md` | Valid state transitions |

## Calendar Sync
GCal, MSFT, and Apple (CalDAV) sync are implemented. Known remaining issues: DB contention on simultaneous syncs, split task part sync.

Soak test docs:
- `juggler-backend/docs/SYNC-SOAK-TEST-GCAL.md` — GCal (completed 2026-04-25)
- `juggler-backend/docs/SYNC-SOAK-TEST-MSFT.md` — MSFT (A-section completed 2026-04-26; B–D pending manual Outlook)
- `juggler-backend/docs/SYNC-SOAK-TEST-APPLE.md` — Apple (partial 2026-04-26; blocked by repush loop bug — do **not** use the Family Calendar)

**Apple soak status (2026-04-26):**
- Bug #1 (UUID rows): FIXED — 121 old-format rows deleted.
- Bug #2 (repush loop): FIXED — `miss_count >= 1` guard added to C2-fix path.
- B1 (pull): ✅ PASS. B5 (MISS_THRESHOLD for native tasks): ✅ PASS. D (stability): ✅ PASS.
- Open: B2/B3/B4 (CDN lag + multi-provider interference), C1/C2/C4 (pending).
- New bugs: #4 multi-provider MISS_THRESHOLD interference, #5 concurrent-sync duplicate active rows.

**Fix applied 2026-04-26:** `buildMsftEventBody` and `buildAppleEventBody` now include `task.url` as "Link: …" (matched GCal behavior)

Integration test credentials go in `juggler-backend/.env.test` (gitignored).
See `juggler-backend/.env.test.example` for required vars.

## AI Enrichment
AI enrichment (titles, descriptions, etc.) is **shared globally** — one enriched version for all users. User overrides stay per-user and are never shared.

## MCP Server
`juggler-mcp/` exposes juggler tasks to external MCP clients (e.g. ClimbRS). Changes here affect the ClimbRS integration.
