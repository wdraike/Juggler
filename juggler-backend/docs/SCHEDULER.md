# Scheduler — Design & Test Cases

## Status
**Current design.** Single source of truth for the scheduler placement algorithm and its test coverage. Consolidates the earlier `SCHEDULER-PRIORITY-REDESIGN.md`, `SCHEDULER-DEPENDENCY-REDESIGN.md`, and `SCHEDULER-TEST-CASES.md` drafts.

## Guiding principles

These three principles resolve every ambiguity in the placement logic. When the algorithm has to make a choice, it works through them in order.

1. **Deadlines drive the schedule; priority is a tie-breaker.** A P3 task due Thursday beats a P1 task with no deadline — the deadline is what gives the work urgency. Priority only decides the outcome when deadlines are equivalent (or both absent).
2. **Past-due tasks are treated as due today AND promoted to P1 for tie-breaking.** "It needed to be done yesterday" is the strongest urgency signal. Classification folds past-due into due-today; the priority boost ensures they win tie-breaks on today's slots.
3. **Pinned items get dropped first during pile-up resolution.** Pinned work is user-anchored, but when the scheduler is resolving a pile-up it treats pinned tasks as the most expendable — the user can re-pin them if they still matter.

---

## Plain-language outline

### 1. What the scheduler does
- Reads the user's tasks
- Picks a day and time for each one it can place
- Writes those picks back to the database
- Pushes a change summary to the frontend via SSE

### 2. Load phase — gather what we're working with
- Load every task the user owns (via `tasks_v` view)
- For each recurring task, expand into one row per upcoming occurrence within the next 56 days
- If a recurring task has split enabled (e.g., 60 min ÷ 30 min chunks = 2), materialize one row per chunk per occurrence (via `reconcile-splits.js`)

### 3. Classify each task by how it can move
- **Fixed** — user locked to a specific time (`when` includes `'fixed'`). Never moved
- **Markers** — reminders at a time that don't occupy a slot. Never moved
- **Pinned** — user set `date_pinned=1` with a specific `scheduled_at`. Never moved by the scheduler (though first to evict during pile-up cleanup)
- **Recurring instances** — see 4b for per-frequency placement rules
- **Deadline tasks** — anything with `due_at`. Past-due (due_at < today) is promoted here: `due_at` is remapped to today and priority is bumped to P1 for tie-breaking
  - A task is a **chain member** if it has `due_at` *or* any task transitively depending on it has `due_at`
  - A **solo anchor** = a chain of size 1 (a deadline task with no prereqs)
- **Free tasks** — no deadline, no chain membership. Place anywhere

### 4. Placement phase — figure out when each task goes

> **Implementation note:** in code (`src/scheduler/unifiedSchedule.js`), these four
> sub-phases are called Phase 0 / Phase 1 / Phase 2 / Phase 3+4. The mapping is:
> 4a → Phase 0 (immovables), 4b → Phase 1 (recurring), 4c → Phase 2
> (deadline work — reserve + forward-pull), 4d → Phase 3 (priority)
> + Phase 4 (flexWhen relaxation). Section **4e** below documents Phase 5
> (recurring rescue), which the earlier outline omitted.

#### 4a. Immovable first  *(Phase 0)*
- Fixed tasks at their locked times
- Markers at their times (no occupancy)
- Pinned tasks at their pinned times

#### 4b. Recurring instances by frequency  *(Phase 1)*
Each recurrence type has a different "valid days" rule. Within valid days, pick the best slot inside the task's `when` window (morning / lunch / afternoon / evening / night).

| Frequency | Valid days | Time flexibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Daily** | the one scheduled day | flex within when-window |
| **Specific day(s) of week** (e.g., Tue/Thu) | the scheduled day only | flex within when-window |
| **Day-of-month** (e.g., 15th) | that calendar date | flex within when-window |
| **Every-N-days** (e.g., every 3) | the computed date | flex within when-window |
| **Times-per-cycle / weekly-count** (e.g., 3× per week) | any eligible day within the cycle window | flex on both day *and* time |
| **Monthly-N-times** | any day within the month matching constraints | flex on day and time |

If the occurrence day has already passed and the recurrence has no remaining flexibility, that occurrence is skipped.

#### 4c. Deadline work — slack-based left-to-right placement  *(Phase 2)*
This is the heart of the scheduler. Fully completed before 4d, so free tasks fill around the committed chain layer.

See **"Deep-dive: 4c"** below for the slack computation, sort order, and forward placement pass.

#### 4d. Free tasks  *(Phase 3 + Phase 4)*
- **Phase 3** — walk priority tiers P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 (priority as tie-break only — these are all deadline-free, so nothing separates them beyond priority). For each task, place at the earliest free slot that respects its `when`, `dayReq`, `start_after`, and dependency constraints.
- **Phase 4** — retry any task that came in with `flexWhen=true` and didn't place in Phase 3, relaxing its `when` to `anytime`. Lets flexible tasks spill into non-preferred windows when capacity is tight.

#### 4e. Recurring rescue  *(Phase 5)*
After Phase 4, look for recurring instances whose template requires placement today (or within the recur window) but which didn't land in Phase 1. For each unplaced recurring:
- Try any remaining gap in the valid window, ignoring the `when` preference
- Try the next valid day if today has no capacity
- Mark `unscheduled=1` with a `missedRecurring` reason if nothing works

This is the last-chance pass before cleanup. Without it, a user who over-books a day loses their daily habit entirely instead of getting a "best effort" landing.

### 5. Cleanup

#### 5a. Merge adjacent same-task chunks
If two chunks of one split task landed back-to-back on the same day, fold them into a single longer block; delete the sibling row. Idempotent — reconcile re-splits and re-merges on the next run.

#### 5b. Resolve pile-ups by eviction order
When multiple tasks overlap on a slot that can't fit them all:

1. **Pinned tasks first** — principle #3. User can re-pin if it still matters
2. **Lowest effective priority next** — effective = own priority, with past-due bumped to P1 per principle #2
3. **Longest-duration first among tied priorities** — the larger task is "more expensive" to reshuffle, so if we're going to evict let it be the one that frees more space
4. **Deterministic `id` tie-break** for repeatability

Evicted tasks:
- Get `unscheduled=1`
- Keep their last proposed `scheduled_at` so the UI can render "was supposed to be at…"
- Carry a past-due badge if applicable

### 6. Persist
- Batch-update every placed task's `scheduled_at` and `duration`
- Clear `date_pinned` on any task the scheduler placed (the scheduler moved it, so the old pin is stale)
- Set `unscheduled=1` on evicted tasks
- All inside a single transaction per user

### 7. Notify
- Emit one SSE event (`schedule:changed`) carrying:
  - **Added** — full task rows for newly inserted items
  - **Changed** — `{id, patch}` pairs showing only the fields that moved
  - **Removed** — IDs of deleted rows
- Frontend merges these into in-memory state; calendar re-renders without re-fetching

### 8. Guard rails — what blocks placement
- No free slot in any allowed when-window → unscheduled
- Day-of-week / day-of-month restriction doesn't match any candidate day → unscheduled
- Dependencies not yet placed → task waits; next scheduler run retries
- Required location/tools aren't available in a candidate slot → skip that slot
- Even after past-due → today remap, if today is full → unscheduled (with past-due badge)
- **Unscheduled-recurring midnight guard**: a recurring master with no specific `time`, `preferredTimeMins`, or `when='fixed'` does NOT get a stored `scheduled_at` at insert time. If we naively called `localToUtc(date, null, tz)`, the result would be midnight-local-as-UTC (e.g. 04:00 UTC in EDT), causing every unconstrained recurring task to pile up at wall-clock midnight and consume morning/lunch capacity the user isn't working. The fix: leave `scheduled_at` NULL on insert and let the placement phase choose a slot from the `when`-window / time-block configuration. See `src/scheduler/runSchedule.js:357-365`.

### 9. Triggers — when the scheduler runs
- User edits a task (UI or MCP)
- Calendar sync (Google / Outlook / Apple) pulls remote changes
- Manual "Run scheduler"
- Task status flipped to done / skip / cancel
- Queue poller runs every ~2 s; dirty users get processed

### 10. Safety — why repeated runs are cheap
- Deterministic IDs (`masterId-YYYYMMDD-N`) — unchanged rows stay byte-identical across runs; no needless UPDATEs
- One scheduler run per user at a time via `sync_locks`
- Drift detection: if an instance's `(split_ordinal, split_total, dur)` doesn't match the chunk plan, reconcile fixes it before placement
- Idempotent on stable input: back-to-back runs on the same data produce zero changes

---

## Split chunks — when one task becomes N rows

A recurring task with `split=1` and `split_min=M` gets divided into chunks at reconcile time. Given a master duration `D`, `N = ceil(D / M)` chunks are produced per occurrence. Chunks share the same `occurrence_ordinal` and differ by `split_ordinal` (1..N).

### Row identity
- Chunk 1 id: `masterUUID-YYYYMMDD`
- Chunk 2+ id: `masterUUID-YYYYMMDD-2`, `masterUUID-YYYYMMDD-3`, …

All chunks reference the same `master_id` and `occurrence_ordinal`.

### Placement
- Chunk 1 inherits the master's preferred time at insert. If the master has no specific time, the chunk's `scheduled_at` is left `null` and the placement phase assigns a slot from the `when`-window / time-block configuration (see §8 "Unscheduled-recurring midnight guard").
- Chunks 2..N start unplaced; the placement phase fits each around chunk 1 using the master's `when` / flex rules.

### Status propagation (done / skip / cancel)
The user's "mark done" intent applies to the **occurrence**, not the chunk. `PUT /api/tasks/:id/status` propagates the status update to every sibling chunk with the same `(master_id, occurrence_ordinal)` pair. Without this, marking chunk 1 done leaves chunk 2 active and the task "comes back" later the same day. See `src/controllers/task.controller.js:updateTaskStatus`.

### Drift detection
If the master's `dur` or `split_min` changes, reconcile recomputes `split_total` for every future occurrence and deletes/inserts chunks to match. A user can also manually change a chunk's `dur` — reconcile detects the drift via the `(split_ordinal, split_total, dur)` invariant.

---

## Deep-dive: 4c (deadline work)

### 4c-1. Build the chain graph and compute slack
- Every task with `deadline` is a **chain tail**
- A task is a **chain member** if it's a tail OR any task that transitively depends on it has `deadline`
  - Walk `depends_on` upstream from each tail — every node visited is in the chain
- A **chain** = {tail} ∪ {all transitive prerequisites of the tail via `depends_on`}
- A **solo anchor** = 1-member chain (tail with no prereqs)
- Past-due tails get `slack=0` and priority bumped to P1 (principle #2)

**Slack computation** — measures urgency as available capacity minus task duration:

- **Solo anchor (own deadline, no chain):** `slack = available_capacity(earliest..deadline) - duration`. Available capacity sums free minutes across eligible days in the task's `when`-windows.
- **Chain member:** Walk backward from the chain tail's hard deadline. For each predecessor P of consumer C, compute `P.mustFinishBy` by subtracting C's duration from C's `mustFinishBy` using a constraint-aware capacity walk (same approach: walk eligible days backward, subtract available minutes). Then `P.slack = available_capacity(P.earliest..P.mustFinishBy) - P.duration`.
- **Past-due:** `slack = 0` (most urgent).
- **No deadline:** `slack = Infinity` (handled in Phase 3/4).

Slack is computed **once** after Phase 1 (recurring placement), using current occupancy. It determines placement *order*, not exact placement — the forward scan handles actual capacity at placement time.

### 4c-2. Sort all constrained items by slack

All constrained items (solo anchors + chain members + constrained split chunks) are sorted into a single queue:

1. **Lowest slack first.** Most urgent tasks get first pick of capacity.
2. **Highest priority wins ties on slack.** Two tasks with identical slack → P1 places before P2.
3. **Longest remaining duration wins ties on priority.** Harder-to-fit tasks pick first.
4. **Deterministic `id` final tie-break** for repeatability.

### 4c-3. Forward placement pass

```
for each item in slack-sorted order:
   place item forward from max(today, start_after_at):
      walk days from earliest → effective_deadline, picking the
      earliest slot that fits (when-window, capacity, day-of-week,
      location, tools, dependency ordering via depsMetByDate)
   if placed: record in globalPlacedEnd
   else: leave for retry/rollback passes
```

### 4c-4. Retry pass
Some items may not place on the first pass because dependencies weren't placed yet (e.g., diamond DAGs where the sort order doesn't perfectly match topological order). After the main pass, retry all unplaced items — their deps may now be satisfied.

### 4c-5. Chain rollback
If a deadline task (chain tail) is still unplaced after the retry pass but its predecessors consumed the available capacity:
1. Unplace all chain members
2. Temporarily hide chain members from the dependency check
3. Re-place in **reverse topological order** (tail first, head last)
4. The tail gets first pick; predecessors fill remaining capacity

This ensures that under capacity pressure, the deadline task is prioritized over its prerequisites. Predecessors that don't fit are left unplaced.

### 4c-6. Past-due overflow
Tasks that couldn't fit within their (expired) deadline window get their deadline ceiling removed and are placed ASAP going forward. They carry a `_pastDue` flag for UI display.

### 4c-7. Chain interaction — slot competition across chains
Because the sort interleaves members from all chains by slack, multiple chains' tasks compete for the same slots. Sort rules from 4c-2 resolve every collision:

- **Different slack**: lower slack places first. A task due tomorrow beats a task due next week.
- **Same slack, different priority**: higher priority places first.
- **Same slack, same priority**: longer duration places first.
- **Shared prereq (P feeds both T1 and T2):** P gets the tighter `mustFinishBy` from whichever consumer imposes the stricter constraint, resulting in lower slack → earlier placement.

### 4c-8. Output of 4c
By the end of 4c:
- Every deadline task is either placed at its earliest feasible position ≤ its deadline, or placed past-due (ASAP with no ceiling), or flagged `unscheduled=1`
- Every chain prereq is either placed such that it ends ≤ its consumer's start, or unplaced (deadline task was prioritized during rollback)
- The "committed" layer is complete. 4d fills remaining gaps with free tasks.

---

## Edge cases

### Cycles in `depends_on`
Detected **once, up front**, immediately after classification. Offending edges dropped deterministically (by `id` sort); a `backwardsDep` warning is logged. The placement pass never sees cycles.

### Prereq with its own deadline
A prereq's effective deadline = `min(consumer.effective_start, own deadline)`. Handles the case where A (due Fri) depends on B (due Wed) — B is constrained to end by Wednesday even though A wants it by Thursday morning.

### Recurring prereq blocks its consumer
A recurring instance placed in 4b sits at a fixed time on its day. If a consumer needs to start before that recurring prereq ends, the consumer skips to the next eligible day. If no eligible day exists within constraints, the consumer is unscheduled.

### Tail unscheduled because deadline day is full
Past-due overflow (4c-6) removes the deadline ceiling and places ASAP. If even then no capacity exists, the task is flagged `unscheduled=1` with a past-due badge.

### Very long chains that can't all fit in the allowed days
Chain rollback (4c-5) prioritizes the tail. Farthest predecessors are left unplaced. Any portion of the chain that fits is placed.

### startAfter without deadline
An unconstrained task whose `start_after_at` is in the future goes to 4d and the forward fill respects the floor.

### startAfter > deadline
Impossible constraint. Detected during window computation. Task flagged with `_unplacedReason: 'impossible_window'`.

## What changed from the prior version of this doc

| Prior wording / design | Correction |
|---|---|
| "Priority is now the primary sort criterion" | **Deadlines are primary, priority is a tie-breaker.** Rewrote the sort order everywhere. |
| Per-chain sequential processing ("Phase 2 pull-forward by priority tier") | **Global backward sweep across all chain members**, ordered by `target_finish`. |
| Forward pull as a uniform chain shift | **Per-member reverse-topo pull**, so diamond-shaped DAG chains tighten internal gaps correctly. |
| Past-due as a separate rescue phase | Folded into classification: past-due = due today + priority bumped to P1. |
| Pinned tasks never evicted | Pinned tasks dropped **first** during pile-up resolution (5b). |
| "If a prereq can't place, continue the chain" | **Roll back the consumer** (and its transitive ancestors) to unscheduled. Leaving a tail placed with its prereq unscheduled creates false confidence. |
| Global backward sweep + forward pull (multi-pass convergence) | **Slack-based left-to-right placement.** Single forward pass sorted by constraint-aware slack. Chain rollback replaces backward sweep for capacity-constrained chains. |
| Past-due reclassified to unconstrained pool | **Past-due stays in constrained pool** with slack=0, P1 boost. Overflow pass places ASAP with no deadline ceiling. |
| Capacity reservation (reserve slots backward from deadline) | **Removed.** Slack-based ordering ensures urgent tasks get first pick naturally. |

## Verification

Tests that prove each guiding principle is honored:

### Principle 1 — deadlines drive, priority tie-breaks
- **Test:** P3 task due Thursday vs P1 task with no deadline. Today has one slot. Expected: P3 (deadline) wins, P1 (no deadline) goes to tomorrow.
- **Test:** Two P2 tasks, both due Friday. Expected: longer-duration task gets first pick of the latest Friday slot; shorter task follows.
- **Test:** Two P2 tasks, no deadlines. Expected: longer-duration first within the priority tier; same priority = duration tie-breaks.

### Principle 2 — past-due = due today + P1
- **Test:** Task due yesterday, own priority P3. Today has a slot contested with on-time P1 task also due today. Expected: both are effective-P1-due-today; longer-duration wins.

### Principle 3 — pinned tasks dropped first
- **Test:** Day over-committed with a pinned P2 and two on-time P1 chain members. Expected: pinned P2 evicted; both P1 chain members stay.

### Algorithmic invariants
- **Slack ordering:** two chains, one due Friday, one due Thursday. Expected: Thursday chain has lower slack → placed first. Friday chain fills around Thursday's commitments.
- **Diamond DAG:** A depends on B and C; B and C both depend on D. Slack sort places D earliest (tightest effective deadline), then B/C, then A. Forward placement satisfies deps naturally.
- **Shared prereq slack:** P feeds T1 (due Fri) and T2 (due Wed). P's effective deadline = `min(T1's effective_start, T2's effective_start)` → tighter bound → lower slack → placed early.
- **Chain rollback under pressure:** Chain A→B→C with C due today and insufficient capacity. Forward pass fills A/B but C can't fit. Rollback unplaces all, re-places C first (tail priority), then B fills remaining. A drops if no room.

### Regression
1. Run full test suite: `cd juggler-backend && npm test`
2. Manual scheduler run on the test user; verify:
   - No P1 deadline task lands at its deadline day's latest slot if earlier slots are free
   - No pinned task blocks a P1 deadline task from placing
   - Past-due tasks surface on today's schedule or in the unscheduled lane with a past-due badge
3. Idempotence: run the scheduler twice on stable input; second run's `executing N DB updates` log line should show 0 or near-zero.

## 20. Priority / Deadline Algorithm Invariants

These encode the three guiding principles at the top of this doc (deadlines over priority; past-due = today + P1; pinned-first eviction) and the slack-based forward placement algorithm.

### Principle 1 — deadlines drive, priority tie-breaks

| UC | Scenario | Expected |
|----|----------|----------|
| PDS-1 | P3 task due Thursday vs P1 task with no deadline. One slot free today. | P3 wins today (deadline → lower slack → placed first). P1 placed on next available day. |
| PDS-2 | Two P2 tasks, both due Friday, different durations. | Longer-duration task placed first (priority tied → duration tie-breaks in slack sort). |
| PDS-3 | Two P2 tasks, neither with a deadline. | Within P2 tier in Phase 3, longer-duration first. |
| PDS-4 | P1 task due in 56 days vs P4 task due tomorrow. | P4 has lower slack → placed first. P1's distant deadline means high slack → placed later. Neither starves the other. |

### Principle 2 — past-due tasks = slack 0 + P1

| UC | Scenario | Expected |
|----|----------|----------|
| PDP-1 | Task due yesterday, own priority P3. | Gets slack=0 + P1 boost. Placed at today's earliest free slot. |
| PDP-2 | Past-due P3 + on-time P1 both due today. One slot left. | Both have slack=0 + P1; longer-duration wins. Loser goes to overflow (placed ASAP with no ceiling) or unscheduled. |
| PDP-3 | Past-due task that can't fit today either. | Overflow pass places ASAP on future day. If still can't fit: `unscheduled=1` with past-due badge. |

### Principle 3 — pinned eviction first

| UC | Scenario | Expected |
|----|----------|----------|
| PE-1 | Day over-committed with a pinned P2 and two on-time P1 chain members. | Pile-up cleanup evicts the pinned P2 first; both P1 chain members stay placed. |
| PE-2 | Pinned P1 vs unpinned P4 chain member, same slot. | Pinned P1 still evicted first — pinning trumps priority in eviction order. |
| PE-3 | Two pinned tasks in the same slot. | Lower-priority pinned evicted first; ties on priority → longer-duration first; final tie-break `id`. |

### Slack-based placement ordering

| UC | Scenario | Expected |
|----|----------|----------|
| SL-1 | Two chains: Chain A tail due Friday, Chain B tail due Thursday. | Thursday chain has lower slack → placed first. Friday chain fills around Thursday's commitments. |
| SL-2 | Chain A (P1 tail due Fri), Chain B (P3 tail due Fri). Both fit only one slot. | Same slack → P1 wins on priority tie-break. P3 chain placed on next available day. |
| SL-3 | Shared prereq P feeds T1 (due Fri) and T2 (due Wed). | P's effective deadline = min(T1's effective_start, T2's effective_start) → lower slack → placed early. |
| SL-4 | Prereq B (own due=Wed) feeds tail A (due Fri). | B's effective deadline = min(A's effective_start, end-of-Wednesday) = Wednesday. B placed by Wed. |

### Diamond DAG placement

| UC | Scenario | Expected |
|----|----------|----------|
| DD-1 | Diamond DAG: A→(B,C)→D, all P2, one-hour each, one-week deadline window. | D has tightest effective deadline → lowest slack → placed first. B/C placed after D. A placed last. All satisfy dep ordering. |
| DD-2 | Chain with one member constrained by `start_after_at = 3 days out`. | Other members placed from today; constrained member waits for its floor date. |
| DD-3 | Chain where earliest slots are blocked by a pinned task. | Tasks placed in earliest available slot after the pin. |

### Chain rollback under capacity pressure

| UC | Scenario | Expected |
|----|----------|----------|
| CR-1 | Chain A→B→C, C due today, only 360m capacity, chain needs 540m. | Forward pass fills A/B but C can't fit. Rollback unplaces all, places C first. B fills remaining. A unplaced. |
| CR-2 | Chain A→B; B can't fit anywhere in deadline window. | B unplaced with diagnostic reason. A placed independently if it has capacity. |

### Idempotence

| UC | Scenario | Expected |
|----|----------|----------|
| IDEM-1 | Run scheduler twice on stable data. | Second run's log: `executing 0 DB updates` (or near-zero from incidental timestamp bumps). No placement changes. |
| IDEM-2 | Run scheduler after editing one task's `dur`. | Only affected chain re-evaluated; unrelated tasks keep byte-identical rows (deterministic ID check). |
