/**
 * Issue #19: task_instances.time varchar(20) → TIME
 *
 * Existing rows store "H:MM AM/PM" strings. MySQL STR_TO_DATE('%l:%i %p')
 * converts them to 24h time which MySQL then stores as TIME.
 *
 * Views must be dropped and rebuilt because MySQL caches column types at
 * view creation time. The template branch changes its time placeholder from
 * CONVERT(NULL USING utf8mb4) to CAST(NULL AS TIME) so the UNION ALL types
 * stay consistent across branches.
 *
 * rowToTask() derives task.time from scheduled_at (not from this column), so
 * no app-layer code changes are needed beyond the scheduler write path.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: After this migration runs, the time column stores "HH:MM:SS".
 * Do NOT pass values read from this column directly to parseTimeToMinutes()
 * or localToUtc() — those functions expect "H:MM AM/PM". The app reads
 * task.time via rowToTask() which derives it from scheduled_at, not this column.
